# 1. Sync with upstream (Fetch, Merge upstream/main into origin/main, Push changes back to origin)
# 2. Get all branches in Fork (except main)
# 3. Check for merged PRs, comment with timestamp, and delete merged branch from forked repo.

# To post comments and delete branches, your GH_TOKEN (used in secrets.FORK_GH_TOKEN4) must have:
#    Repo scope
#    Write access to your fork
